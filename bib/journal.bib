  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to explore three computational approaches to ethnographic research within digital learning environments: virtual ethnography; quantitative ethnography; and computational ethnography. Recently, researchers have become more interested in computational ethnographic approaches due to their alignment with the massive datasets currently available in digital archives. Although these approaches have attracted growing attention in recent years, their methodological characteristics (e.g., goals, procedures, and techniques) have yet to be fully explored. In this scoping review, we explore existing and the three emerging computational methods for ethnographic research, along with their applications within digital learning environments. We first conduct a scoping review by sampling and synthesizing 86 articles using bibliometric and thematic analyses. This review is then used to reveal the similarities and differences among the three computationally-enabled ethnographic approaches and engage in a concomitant discussion of digital learning designs. In addition, this study explores implications of this type of research for learning design. This research contributes to a better understanding of the characteristics and applications of computational approaches across various digital learning environments.},

  abstract     = {Purpose In response to the underexplored need for holistically inclusive makerspaces for learning, we put propose the “SCAFFOLD” framework, which considers equity, inclusion and accessibility in the design of spaces and activities for socioculturally diverse learners. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a universal design (UD) framework that is intersectionally inclusive for learners with diverse needs in makerspaces and maker activities. This paper provides conjecture mapping to put forth theoretical and empirical arguments for the design of holistically inclusive makerspaces that consider gender equity and cultural inclusivity, as well as accessibility for diverse learners with divergent and unique abilities and dis/abilities. Findings Combining related literature and three existing UD frameworks (i.e. UD, web accessibility and UD for learning) and prior research on equity and inclusivity in making, this paper proposes the integration of eight principles, which leverage individuals’ diverse abilities to become agentic makers: simplicity, collaboration, accessibility, flexibility, fail-safe, object-oriented, linkability and diversity. Research limitations/implications Researchers who have implemented conjecture maps (Lee et al., 2018) have found them to be useful for developing theory and learning designs grounded in research and practice. However, it should be noted that design research is iterative and contextual, and conjecture maps are effective in providing visibility and rigor, but are meant to be flexible and responsive to changes in context (Lee et al., 2018; Sandoval, 2014). Originality/value This paper provides practical guidelines and principles for researchers, educators, instructional designers and product developers to assess and redesign makerspaces and activities that are intersectionally and universally inclusive, equitable and accessible.},
