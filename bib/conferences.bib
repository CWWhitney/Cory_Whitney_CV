  abstract = {Fruit tree-based agroforestry has been promoted as an alternative farming practice in upland Northwest Vietnam, which may replace erosion-prone staple crop monocultures. Although many studies have focused on evaluating the performance of agroforestry systems at the plot level, there has been little research on how farmers perceive and evaluate agroforestry and how adoption barriers may be overcome. We combined the Q method, which aims to explore commonalities and differences in farmer perspectives (discourses), with system thinking to understand farmers' decision-making processes within the adoption context. Through the Q method, we identified three different discourses among agroforestry farmers on the farm-level impacts of adoption. Two of the three discourses are in favour of agroforestry, highlighting its beneficial impacts on livelihoods and environment, through diversification of household income and soil erosion control. The disagreement in farmer perceptions reflected the diversity of farmers' experiences and adoption management strategies. We also generated a collective development pathway where farmers navigated and adapted the agroforestry practices to overcome adoption challenges. To illustrate these pathways, we used system thinking to visualise farmers' mental models, which reflected a whole-system approach to farm resource management. Farmers leveraged the beneficial impacts of agroforestry and adaptively managed challenges, drawing upon systemic understandings of trade-offs and synergies. We identified structural barriers, such as unstable farm-gate prices, that may need intervention at higher levels. In addition to technical and financial support, a proper integration of informal and formal social networks in local agroforestry innovation systems may promote effective learning and cooperation to overcome both field-level and structural challenges. System thinking and its outcomes allow for social learning and assist researchers and policymakers in designing research and support mechanisms. While our study focused on the development of agroforestry, the approaches could be adapted to study a wide range of other agricultural innovation systems.},

  abstract = {Despite being extremely important for holistic research, gender is often overlooked in agricultural and development-related studies. Rural farm women in low- and middle-income countries are the main subject of rural agriculture development interventions for women's empowerment. We study factors influencing their empowerment in agricultural development to support researchers in capturing gender in development-oriented agricultural modelling efforts. We generated a literature-derived decision model by applying Monte Carlo simulation, a random sampling method, to include the uncertainty and riskiness of the decision outcome. The underlying Decision Analysis impact pathway describes women's empowerment within their social environments through gains in the areas where they are disadvantaged, i.e., education and training, economic strength, agricultural resources, health care and nutritious food, further strengthening their ability to work and, thus, financial resources. Safety is a crucial constraint for rural women since they can face danger within families and communities. We programmed the model as a Shiny app (https://femiaculture.shinyapps.io/femiaculture/) tool to be used by research teams for estimating the gains in rural women's empowerment resulting from any research efforts. The app can also support individual women using their own inputs. Based on research on prior empowerment interventions and the system of empowerment, we show that increasing gains for women and supporting empowerment is superior to the status quo if violence against women does not increase. Further holistic, system-oriented thinking and trans- and interdisciplinary research can reduce bias and include women as decision-makers over their empowerment. Such inclusive studies of female empowerment could produce actionable future models and web apps that can potentially empower rural women in different areas.},

  abstract = {Many fruit and nut tree species depend on low temperatures during the cold season to overcome dormancy. Lacking chill may result in diminished bud burst rates and uncoordinated blooming, both of which can cause severe yield losses. With global warming leading to rising winter temperatures in many growing regions, assessments of temperature requirements during dormancy and projections of tree phenology have gained renewed attention. A number of studies in recent decades have attempted to improve the predictive performance of phenology models and to integrate ecophysiological as well as genetic processes. Nevertheless, the development of modeling frameworks that are readily applicable to data are still lacking. As a result, many practitioners must use outdated models, which have not been parameterized for specific species and/or varieties, and have also not been validated for the climate of interest. To help close the gap between scientific developments and the need for applied analyses, we recently re-implemented the Dynamic Model of chill accumulation in the widely distributed programming environment R. We linked this sub-model with a heat model to project bloom dates and developed a framework for automated model fitting. Here, we present the application of the framework to long-term data sets of bloom dates of sweet cherry (Prunus avium) to demonstrate the use of the model and its predictive performance.},

The war in Syria has now been going on for 10 years since it started in 2011. In addition to the many consequences of this conflict, 6.5 million people are unable to meet their food needs and a further 2.5 million people are at risk of food insecurity. Wild food plants are already culturally important in the region and may be supplementing local diets during this conflict. Our study aimed to uncover which wild plant species are used by local people, and what role they play in human nutrition during the current crisis. The fieldwork was carried out between March 2020 and March 2021 in the Tartus governorate located in the coastal region of Syria. We used semistructured interviews with 50 participants in 26 villages about their use of wild plant species for food and drink. We recorded the vernacular names, uses, plant parts used, modes of preparation and consumption and frequency of use. We documented 75 wild food plant species used for food and drink. Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Lamiaceae were the most represented botanical families, whereas Origanum syriacum, Rhus coriaria, Eryngium creticum, and Cichorium intybus were among the species most quoted by informants. Sleeq, Zaatar, and Louf were the most popular wild plant-based dishes. The young aerial part was the most common plant part to be used. However, the nutritional composition of these wild food plants is not well documented. More research will be helpful in determining the role that these wild food plants play in supplementing local diets during the conflict.},

  abstract = {Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) is carried out with the objective of regaining ecological functions and enhancing human well-being through intervention in degrading ecosystems. However, uncertainties and risks related to FLR make it difficult to predict long-term outcomes and inform management plans. We applied a Stochastic Impact Evaluation framework (SIE) to simulate returns on investment in the case of FLR interventions in a degraded dry Afromontane forest while accounting for uncertainties. We ran 10,000 iterations of a Monte Carlo simulation that projected FLR outcomes over a period of 25 years. Our simulations show that investments in assisted natural regeneration, enrichment planting, exclosure establishment and soil-water conservation structures all have a greater than 77\% chance of positive returns. Sensitivity analysis of these outcomes indicated that the greatest threat to positive cashflows is the time required to achieve the targeted ecological outcomes. Value of Information (VOI) analysis indicated that the biggest priority for further measurement in this case is the maturity age of exclosures at which maximum biomass accumulation is achieved. The SIE framework enabled us to clearly define the objectives of FLR activities and quantify the expected impacts on land use and land cover trends. With the framework, we translated outcomes into economic impacts for easy integration into decision-making processes. For FLR implementers, initial costs incurred to establish livelihood interventions, mobilise communities, strengthen social governance structures, and provide capacity building can result in net losses in the first few years. Implementers will therefore need significant financial support to see their interventions through to the medium and long term.},

  abstract = {The potential yields of deciduous fruit and nut trees are strongly affected by the climatic conditions that regulate dormancy and subsequent flowering. However, the realized yield at the end of the growing season depends on several additional factors including environmental conditions and management measures. These modulating factors dilute the direct effect of chill accumulation and frustrate efforts to forecast yields. Such forecasts are also limited by a lack of data, which complicates the assessment of the relationship between chill and yield. However, information on how diminishing chill impacts crop yield is crucial for farmers and other decision-makers, particularly in warm fruit and nut growing regions. We address this challenge by adopting a probabilistic approach to yield forecasting. This approach incorporates uncertainty and generates predictions that do not consist of precise numbers, but yield expectations expressed as probability distributions. We demonstrate a set of functions that we developed in the R programming language to generate forecasts of possible yields with given chill. We apply these methods to data sets of two sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) cultivars `Lapins' and `Brooks'.},
